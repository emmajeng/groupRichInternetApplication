			<h3>What is HTML?</h3>
						<li>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language</li>
						<li>HTML describes the structure of Web pages using markup</li>
						<li>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages</li>
						<li>HTML elements are represented by tags</li>
						<li>HTML tags label pieces of content such as "heading", "paragraph", "table", and so on</li>
						<li>Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to render the content of the page</li>
						<br><br>

					<p>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects, such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. It provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <code>&lt;img&gt; </code> &lt;and&gt; <code> &lt;span&gt; </code> introduce content into the page directly. Others such as <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.

					HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript which affect the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), maintainer of both the HTML and the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997</p>
